# NLP_Applications
The repository contains notebooks written in Python about NLP applications. The first folder created in this repository maintains the implementation of multi-label text classification on movies dataset. In the long term this repository will include hands-on applications and notebooks for various field of the NLP discipline.

## Table of Contents
1) **Folder 1: Multi-label text classification**<br>
This folder serves as a mainting repository of the code used in my thesis title: *Movie Recommendation engine using an interactive conversational agent*. The code is updated regularly to Python, Tensorflow, Keras and other packages updates. The current version of the notebook are written in two Python environments.
* Parts 1, 2, 4, and 5 are written using Python 3.7.4 and 3.9.1
* Part 3 is the only part written in Python 3.6.9 because of the Tensorflow and Keras libraries.
* Tensorflow version 2.4.1

The folder contains only the notebooks and not the datasets used. Any third party or individual can check the code and use parts of the code as per the individual's needs. The datasets can be accessed upon request on this email: spanos.nikolaos@outlook.com

Please note that for using large parts of the notebooks it is advised to cite researcher's work using one of the following templates:
