    "**Part 2.1.1:** Will correct any mistake found in the dataset from the previous notebook versions and will add a new column to the dataset. The new column will be the official TMDB id of each movie. In the same part new columns will be added to further support the *training* and the *accuracy* of the recommendation algorithm. The new columns currently added into the dataset to enrich the written text for each movie are:\n",

The place is Poland and the year is 1945, right after the end of WWII. Russians soldiers and tanks are ubiquitous and the fledgling communist government has a tenuous hold on power, as Nationalist partisans roam the forests and conduct night raids. Ethnic Germans are being deported back to Germany in appalling conditions. The corruption and misdeeds of the prewar Polish government are being exposed, principally the appalling lack of military preparation prior to the German onslaught in 1939. All of this is seen through the eyes of Jerzy Ostrovsky, a ten year old child. Jerzy is blond and blue-eyed, thus a candidate for membership in the mythical \"Aryan race\"; he was an unwitting part of a Nazi program to take by force children like him to Germany to be indoctrinated as \"culturally German\". Jerzy has just been repatriated and returned to his family; his mother (whose welcome is strangely subdued) and his paternal grandparents (Jerzy's father is missing since 1939 and presumed dead). Jerzy's family seems to have weathered the Nazi occupation; they still possess their large country estate more or less intact. Jerzy's mother refuses to play her role as widow of a hero and is struggling to lead a normal life, while Jerzy's grandfather clings to Poland's traditions and past military glory. Jerzy is more proficient in German than in Polish (he is taunted and abused by other children at school) and he refuses to believe his father is dead. Jerzy's take on reality is poetic and has at times the quality of a fairy tale, and we see what he actually witnesses as well what he imagines or dreams. The movie is heavily symbolic, with an eagle, a white horse and the father's ghost a part of the plot. Director Jerzy Kaszubowski, who also wrote the script does an excellent job of integrating disparate elements into a coherent movie, and acting is excellent all around.

Transcending time and place, date and setting, the film is a coming-of-age tale far from the thematically similar Tunisian entry \"The Silences of the Palace\", which depicting in scorching detail the plight of the woman in this society and her expectory burden of rape and sexual favors, \"Halfaouine\" depicts male-female Tunisian relations as much like our own American, with a lot of strong and knowing females and the lascivious lunkhead sweethearts who love them. Into this world is twelve-year-old Noura, endeavoring on a quest to understand the world of women, how to be a man, relationships, and above all, to see boobs.

The film has a solid grasp for both a good punchline (for instance, when a womanizer gives a young boy advice on how to get with women, the film cuts directly to the boy getting punished for harassing local girls) and a good visual joke (as when a street argument is cooled as the participants find a common bond: ogling a woman as she saunters away), functioning as little more than mindless entertainment. It fails to be overly notable outside of surprising me how comfortable Tunisia is with nudity, as the film is filled to the brim with it. Lead actor Selim Boughedir is not only sort of dumb-looking, but also only seems to have two facial expressions: A blank slate and a sheepish grin. The rest of the characters are ill-defined, and most of the women, with the except his town-temptress aunt, are more notable for their bodies than their lives, which, it could be argued, is somewhat appropriate, considering the movie's title character is a horny, inexperienced twelve-year-old. In the end, it's a harmless bit a fluff, a sex comedy with broad characters and a surplus of nudity, and more than anything else, I think it's nice to know that no matter where you're from, be it the suburbs of Michigan, the neighborhoods of Paris or the streets of Tunisia, every boy around the world just wants to get a little action. {Grade: 7. 5/10 (B-) / #15 (of 24) of 1990}]</td>\n",

This film was a diamond in the rough. It not keeps true to the pure nature of the world of fashion and it's industry. It finally provides the respect needed for the modeling industry. \\nThis film follows the most highly respected models in the Fashion History. A 90+ minute chronicle of Christy Turlington's world wind life during collections in the fashion capitals. Moving from Milan to Paris and then ending in New York. The movie provides a realistic view of a model and the lives they lead. They are just like the rest of us. One exception - in the case of Christy, she is flawless by the centimeter. What I would like to see is Christy do a follow up documentary - since the filming of this movie in 1993 she has grown considerably in her career as well as her personal life. \\nThe documentary explains why Christy is one of the very few Supermodels still on top of an industry that is ever changing.]   \n",
       "139                                                                                                                                                                                                        [The Polish title translates to Shadows, but the movie can be found in the rental services under the name The Road Home (which risks confusion with a 1999 Chinese movie with the same title). The place is Poland and the year is 1945, right after the end of WWII. Russians soldiers and tanks are ubiquitous and the fledgling communist government has a tenuous hold on power, as Nationalist partisans roam the forests and conduct night raids. Ethnic Germans are being deported back to Germany in appalling conditions. The corruption and misdeeds of the prewar Polish government are being exposed, principally the appalling lack of military preparation prior to the German onslaught in 1939. All of this is seen through the eyes of Jerzy Ostrovsky, a ten year old child. Jerzy is blond and blue-eyed, thus a candidate for membership in the mythical \"Aryan race\"; he was an unwitting part of a Nazi program to take by force children like him to Germany to be indoctrinated as \"culturally German\". Jerzy has just been repatriated and returned to his family; his mother (whose welcome is strangely subdued) and his paternal grandparents (Jerzy's father is missing since 1939 and presumed dead). Jerzy's family seems to have weathered the Nazi occupation; they still possess their large country estate more or less intact. Jerzy's mother refuses to play her role as widow of a hero and is struggling to lead a normal life, while Jerzy's grandfather clings to Poland's traditions and past military glory. Jerzy is more proficient in German than in Polish (he is taunted and abused by other children at school) and he refuses to believe his father is dead. Jerzy's take on reality is poetic and has at times the quality of a fairy tale, and we see what he actually witnesses as well what he imagines or dreams. The movie is heavily symbolic, with an eagle, a white horse and the father's ghost a part of the plot. Director Jerzy Kaszubowski, who also wrote the script does an excellent job of integrating disparate elements into a coherent movie, and acting is excellent all around. If anything could be objected is that knowledge of recent Polish history is taken for granted, which may disorient at times the non-Polish viewer (like me).]   \n",

And the actual assassination is not clear at the end. Maybe I am wrong for expecting a solution. But this documentary is about the production team's efforts to find people related to the event and that is about it. Much conspiracy. Speculation. Not much data. Yet a lot of \"I heard from someone\". In the end I felt this was a waste of my time. Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail. ch]   \n",
       "615    [\"Halfaouine: Boy of the Terraces\" (1990, Ferid Boughedir) Apparently puberty's the same for everybody, everywhere. Transcending time and place, date and setting, the film is a coming-of-age tale far from the thematically similar Tunisian entry \"The Silences of the Palace\", which depicting in scorching detail the plight of the woman in this society and her expectory burden of rape and sexual favors, \"Halfaouine\" depicts male-female Tunisian relations as much like our own American, with a lot of strong and knowing females and the lascivious lunkhead sweethearts who love them. Into this world is twelve-year-old Noura, endeavoring on a quest to understand the world of women, how to be a man, relationships, and above all, to see boobs. Now, this is not the demented and disgusting brilliance of something like \"Leolo\", and it's not any outrageous or controversial endeavor on the level of \"Maladolescenza\" or \"Murmur of the Heart\", but its intent is to be breezy entertaining, not to get people talking about it in shocked whispers to their friends. The film has a solid grasp for both a good punchline (for instance, when a womanizer gives a young boy advice on how to get with women, the film cuts directly to the boy getting punished for harassing local girls) and a good visual joke (as when a street argument is cooled as the participants find a common bond: ogling a woman as she saunters away), functioning as little more than mindless entertainment. It fails to be overly notable outside of surprising me how comfortable Tunisia is with nudity, as the film is filled to the brim with it. Lead actor Selim Boughedir is not only sort of dumb-looking, but also only seems to have two facial expressions: A blank slate and a sheepish grin. The rest of the characters are ill-defined, and most of the women, with the except his town-temptress aunt, are more notable for their bodies than their lives, which, it could be argued, is somewhat appropriate, considering the movie's title character is a horny, inexperienced twelve-year-old. In the end, it's a harmless bit a fluff, a sex comedy with broad characters and a surplus of nudity, and more than anything else, I think it's nice to know that no matter where you're from, be it the suburbs of Michigan, the neighborhoods of Paris or the streets of Tunisia, every boy around the world just wants to get a little action. {Grade: 7. 5/10 (B-) / #15 (of 24) of 1990}]   \n",

However this movie is not just a lesson in History - it makes you be Kaloyan, feel his emotions, think the way he thinks. His character is realistic as well - equally fair and brutal, which a real leader had to be. The story is complex and dynamic as it also features minor characters (in terms of history); the music is suitable and the battle scenes are well made. Its atmosphere is certainly memorable. I consider the film as obligatory for Bulgarian movie fans; personally I prefer it to Aszparuh.]   \n",

The film tells the story of a painter of religious paintings and his apprentice who are hired by the town council of a small town in the Greek province to restore the paintings of their church. The painter and his apprentice begin their journey, arrive to the town, meet with all kinds of people, make philosophic conversations, do almost everything except getting their job done, but this doesn't matter at all. As the Greek poet Kostas Kavafis writes in his poem \"Ithaki\". what is important is not reaching the destination but the journey itself. This is exactly the case in the film. There is a strong comic aura in the film and the plot flows smoothly without the film becoming boring or \"pseudo-sophisticated\", something that was happening in most of the Greek films of the 80's and early 90's. This film reconciled me with the Greek cinema.]   \n",

This film was a diamond in the rough. It not keeps true to the pure nature of the world of fashion and it's industry. It finally provides the respect needed for the modeling industry. \\nThis film follows the most highly respected models in the Fashion History. A 90+ minute chronicle of Christy Turlington's world wind life during collections in the fashion capitals. Moving from Milan to Paris and then ending in New York. The movie provides a realistic view of a model and the lives they lead. They are just like the rest of us. One exception - in the case of Christy, she is flawless by the centimeter. What I would like to see is Christy do a follow up documentary - since the filming of this movie in 1993 she has grown considerably in her career as well as her personal life. \\nThe documentary explains why Christy is one of the very few Supermodels still on top of an industry that is ever changing.  \n",
       "139                                                                                                                                                                                                        The Polish title translates to Shadows, but the movie can be found in the rental services under the name The Road Home (which risks confusion with a 1999 Chinese movie with the same title). The place is Poland and the year is 1945, right after the end of WWII. Russians soldiers and tanks are ubiquitous and the fledgling communist government has a tenuous hold on power, as Nationalist partisans roam the forests and conduct night raids. Ethnic Germans are being deported back to Germany in appalling conditions. The corruption and misdeeds of the prewar Polish government are being exposed, principally the appalling lack of military preparation prior to the German onslaught in 1939. All of this is seen through the eyes of Jerzy Ostrovsky, a ten year old child. Jerzy is blond and blue-eyed, thus a candidate for membership in the mythical \"Aryan race\"; he was an unwitting part of a Nazi program to take by force children like him to Germany to be indoctrinated as \"culturally German\". Jerzy has just been repatriated and returned to his family; his mother (whose welcome is strangely subdued) and his paternal grandparents (Jerzy's father is missing since 1939 and presumed dead). Jerzy's family seems to have weathered the Nazi occupation; they still possess their large country estate more or less intact. Jerzy's mother refuses to play her role as widow of a hero and is struggling to lead a normal life, while Jerzy's grandfather clings to Poland's traditions and past military glory. Jerzy is more proficient in German than in Polish (he is taunted and abused by other children at school) and he refuses to believe his father is dead. Jerzy's take on reality is poetic and has at times the quality of a fairy tale, and we see what he actually witnesses as well what he imagines or dreams. The movie is heavily symbolic, with an eagle, a white horse and the father's ghost a part of the plot. Director Jerzy Kaszubowski, who also wrote the script does an excellent job of integrating disparate elements into a coherent movie, and acting is excellent all around. If anything could be objected is that knowledge of recent Polish history is taken for granted, which may disorient at times the non-Polish viewer (like me).  \n",

And the actual assassination is not clear at the end. Maybe I am wrong for expecting a solution. But this documentary is about the production team's efforts to find people related to the event and that is about it. Much conspiracy. Speculation. Not much data. Yet a lot of \"I heard from someone\". In the end I felt this was a waste of my time. Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail. ch  \n",
       "615    \"Halfaouine: Boy of the Terraces\" (1990, Ferid Boughedir) Apparently puberty's the same for everybody, everywhere. Transcending time and place, date and setting, the film is a coming-of-age tale far from the thematically similar Tunisian entry \"The Silences of the Palace\", which depicting in scorching detail the plight of the woman in this society and her expectory burden of rape and sexual favors, \"Halfaouine\" depicts male-female Tunisian relations as much like our own American, with a lot of strong and knowing females and the lascivious lunkhead sweethearts who love them. Into this world is twelve-year-old Noura, endeavoring on a quest to understand the world of women, how to be a man, relationships, and above all, to see boobs. Now, this is not the demented and disgusting brilliance of something like \"Leolo\", and it's not any outrageous or controversial endeavor on the level of \"Maladolescenza\" or \"Murmur of the Heart\", but its intent is to be breezy entertaining, not to get people talking about it in shocked whispers to their friends. The film has a solid grasp for both a good punchline (for instance, when a womanizer gives a young boy advice on how to get with women, the film cuts directly to the boy getting punished for harassing local girls) and a good visual joke (as when a street argument is cooled as the participants find a common bond: ogling a woman as she saunters away), functioning as little more than mindless entertainment. It fails to be overly notable outside of surprising me how comfortable Tunisia is with nudity, as the film is filled to the brim with it. Lead actor Selim Boughedir is not only sort of dumb-looking, but also only seems to have two facial expressions: A blank slate and a sheepish grin. The rest of the characters are ill-defined, and most of the women, with the except his town-temptress aunt, are more notable for their bodies than their lives, which, it could be argued, is somewhat appropriate, considering the movie's title character is a horny, inexperienced twelve-year-old. In the end, it's a harmless bit a fluff, a sex comedy with broad characters and a surplus of nudity, and more than anything else, I think it's nice to know that no matter where you're from, be it the suburbs of Michigan, the neighborhoods of Paris or the streets of Tunisia, every boy around the world just wants to get a little action. {Grade: 7. 5/10 (B-) / #15 (of 24) of 1990}  \n",

However this movie is not just a lesson in History - it makes you be Kaloyan, feel his emotions, think the way he thinks. His character is realistic as well - equally fair and brutal, which a real leader had to be. The story is complex and dynamic as it also features minor characters (in terms of history); the music is suitable and the battle scenes are well made. Its atmosphere is certainly memorable. I consider the film as obligatory for Bulgarian movie fans; personally I prefer it to Aszparuh.  \n",

The film tells the story of a painter of religious paintings and his apprentice who are hired by the town council of a small town in the Greek province to restore the paintings of their church. The painter and his apprentice begin their journey, arrive to the town, meet with all kinds of people, make philosophic conversations, do almost everything except getting their job done, but this doesn't matter at all. As the Greek poet Kostas Kavafis writes in his poem \"Ithaki\". what is important is not reaching the destination but the journey itself. This is exactly the case in the film. There is a strong comic aura in the film and the plot flows smoothly without the film becoming boring or \"pseudo-sophisticated\", something that was happening in most of the Greek films of the 80's and early 90's. This film reconciled me with the Greek cinema.  \n",

Who is audience for it supposed to be? Self hating gays? Unhappy heterosexuals? Miserable bisexuals? Selfish jackasses? If so than they hit the nail on the head but if their target audience was discriminating viewers the makers of this picture must have been sorely disappointed, as anybody unfortunate enough to see this will be too. Badly written, poorly acted by most of the cast amateurishly shot and with a callous attitude towards its characters there ISN'T something here for anyone.  \n",
